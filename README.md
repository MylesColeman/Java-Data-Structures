# Java: Data Structures
**University Year 1 | Semester 2**

A comprehensive collection of fundamental data structures and algorithmic implementations in Java. Features custom-built Abstract Data Types (ADTs), including dynamic arrays, multiple linked list architectures, and dual-implementation stacks and queues.

## 🕹️ Project Overview
This repository serves as a technical archive of my progression through foundational Computer Science principles. It tracks the journey from initial Java syntax validation to the engineering of complex, node-based architectures and memory-efficient data management systems.

## 📂 Repository Contents

### 00. Language Foundations
* **Welcome Prototype:** An introductory implementation used to establish JDK configuration and master basic Java class structure and console output.

### 01. Array ADT
* **Array Abstract Data Type:** Developed a custom array-based structure featuring manual indexing, boundary validation, and element manipulation logic.

### 02. Linked List Architectures
* **Node-Based Logic:** Implemented manual pointer-style logic to connect and traverse independent `ListNode` objects.
* **Architecture Variations:** Includes Standard, Circular, and Doubly Linked Lists to demonstrate an understanding of bidirectional navigation and circular traversal logic.

### 03. Stacks and Queues
* **Dual-Implementation Strategy:** Developed both Array-based and List-based versions of Stack and Queue structures to explore the performance trade-offs between contiguous and dynamic memory allocation.
* **State Protocols:** Managed strict LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) and FIFO (First-In-First-Out) access rules.

## 🧪 Testing & Validation
Technical accuracy is maintained through **JUnit** unit testing. These test suites validate:
* **Edge Cases:** Verifying structure behaviour during interactions with empty or single-node lists.
* **Positional Logic:** Validating insertions and deletions at specific indices within dynamic structures.

## 💻 Technical Specs
* **Language:** Java
* **Tools:** NetBeans, JUnit
* **Methodology:** Abstract Data Type (ADT) Design
